# M1310 Bot:
A simple voice assistant that will help me perform day to day tasks with ease. I have always wanted to build my own virtual assistant as I imagined how easier it would be to send emails without typing a single word, doing Wikipedia searches without opening web browsers, and performing many other daily tasks like playing music with the help of a single voice command.
